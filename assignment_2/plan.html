  <h1>CP1406/CP5638 – Assignment 2 – Updated Project Plan</h1>
  <p><strong>Name:</strong> Wangbohong</p>

  <h2>Goal</h2>
  <p>
    The goal of the 100SMILES Dental Care website is to increase new and returning
    patient enquiries and confirmed bookings in Razole. The site will do this by:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Clearly explaining the range of services for children, adults, and seniors.</li>
    <li>Highlighting promotions such as the free dental check-up day and discounts on the
        Annual Dental Check-Up package.</li>
    <li>Making it easy to contact the clinic and submit an online booking request at any time.</li>
    <li>Reassuring visitors through staff profiles, clinic images, and descriptions of
        advanced dental technologies.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
  <p>
    The success of the website will be evaluated using both enquiry and engagement
    measures:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The number of online booking form submissions per month.</li>
    <li>The number of phone calls and email enquiries that mention the website or online form.</li>
    <li>
      Web analytics data (for example, from Google Analytics), including:
      <ul>
        <li>Total visits and proportion of new visitors.</li>
        <li>Average time spent on the Services and Contact pages.</li>
        <li>Click-through rate on key calls-to-action such as “Book an appointment”.</li>
        <li>Reduction in bounce rate on the homepage after improvements.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The number of patients using promotions advertised on the site
        (free check-up day, Annual Check-Up discount).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Target Audience</h2>
  <p>
    The primary target audience is people living in Razole and nearby areas who require
    general or specialist dental care. This includes:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Parents with children</strong> who need regular check-ups, preventive care,
        and comfortable appointments with a pediatric dentist.</li>
    <li><strong>Busy working adults</strong> looking for convenient booking options, clear
        information about treatments, and pricing or promotional offers.</li>
    <li><strong>Elderly patients and carers</strong> who may require restorative or
        ongoing dental treatment and who need reassurance about gentle, long-term care.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The design therefore focuses on clear navigation, readable text, friendly images of
    staff and patients, and obvious calls-to-action so that all age groups can quickly
    find what they need and feel confident to book.
